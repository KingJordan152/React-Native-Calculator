# React-Native-Calculator
This is just a little calculator app I made so I could practice using React Native. I probably won't come back to it, so I apologize for any bugs in advanced.

##Installation Instructions
1) Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2) Install Expo using this command: `npm install -g expo-cli`
3) Download the Expo app on your smartphone.
4) Clone this repository.
5) cd to your clone's file using Command Prompt or a terminal of your choosing.
6) Type `npm start`
7) A QR code will pop up after some time. Scan it with your smartphone.
8) Enjoy the app :)
